# OSRS

This is my first project that involved a UI. I made this using Scene Builder.
Basically the Hiscores searches and retrieves any player's stats from Old School Runescape.
you can switch to the price checker, in there you can check the price of any item in old school runescape that is in the 
grand exchange
